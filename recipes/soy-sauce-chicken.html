        <h3 class="info-title">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Prepare chicken</strong></li>

            <p>Optional step: rinse chicken (4 lb) in water, focusing on inside the breast and any debris in the cavity.</p>
            <p>Let the chicken drain, and then place into a large pan or dish.</p>
            <p>Pour boiling water onto the chicken to slightly blanch it.</p>
            <p>Put the chicken in a bowl, with the cavity opening down, to drain.</p>

            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Prepare aromatics</strong></li>
            <p>Wrap the star anise (3 piece) in a paper towel, and then smack them with the side of a heavy knife. Set the crushed pieces in a bowl.</p>
            <p>Cut the green onions (3 stalk) into thirds, or long batons.</p>
            <p>Cut the ginger (1 oz) into slices.</p>
            <p>Cut the shallots (2 ) into quarters.</p>

            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Cook aromatics</strong></li>
            <p>Heat the wok on high heat. Add oil (2 tbsp).</p>
            <p>Add the ginger, and fry for 20 seconds.</p>
            <p>Add the shallots, and fry for 20 seconds.</p>
            <p>Add the crushed star anise, and fry for 10 seconds.</p>
            <p>Add the green onion, and fry for 10 seconds.</p>
            <h4>Add sauces</h4>
            <p>Pour in rice wine (3 tbsp) and stir it in.</p>
            <p>Add Kikkoman® Soy Sauce (12 oz) (light soy sauce), and cook for 30 seconds.</p>
            <p>Then add boiling water (16 oz), and cook for 30 seconds.</p>
            <p>Add rock sugar (3 oz), and cook for 30 seconds.</p>
            <p>Add Kikkoman® Tamari Soy Sauce (1 tbsp) and cook for 20 seconds. Add the rest of the rice wine (3 tbsp).</p>
            <p>Turn the heat to low and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the sugar has fully dissolved.</p>
        

            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Cook chicken in sauce</strong></li>
            <p>Transfer chicken to a larger pot that's deep enough so that the chicken will be at least half-submerged in the sauce. Pour the sauce carefully in, and bring it all to a simmer on low heat. Keep the chicken soaking in the simmering sauce for 15 minutes with the lid on.</p>
            <p>Then, carefully flip the chicken over and place the lid back on, and soak, covered, for about 15 minutes, still on low heat.</p>
            <p>If the chicken is smaller, it may be cooked through at this point. If it is larger, flip it one more time and cook for an addition 10 minutes, again on low heat with the lid on.</p>
            <p>Check for doneness by poking a chopstick into the thickest part of the chicken. If the juices run clear, it's ready. If there is any redness in the liquid, it's not cooked through yet. Otherwise, you can use a food thermometer to check for an internal temperature of 165ºF (75°C).</p>

            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Put chicken on ice</strong></li>
            <p>Prepare a large bowl with a bag of ice (1 gallon bags) on the bottom. Transfer the cooked chicken onto the ice, and then place a second bag of ice (1 gallon bags) on the top. </p>
            <p>Let the chicken cool this way for 10-20 minutes before cutting into it.</p>

            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Boil sauce</strong></li>
            <p>While waiting for the chicken to cool, bring the soy sauce to a boil. You'll only be using 3 ladlefuls of it for this dish, so store the rest of it for later use in other dishes.</p>

            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Cut chicken & plate</strong></li>
            <p>Remember to put each section back to recreate the whole chicken.</p>
            <p>Chop the chicken in half lengthwise to get two symmetrical halves.</p>
            <p>Cut along the joint to separate the wing. Then, pull the thigh away from the body and cut it off. You'll end up with the drumstick and thigh in one piece, separated from remaining body, which is mostly breast. Cut that in half lengthwise, and then chop each half into 1-inch wide pieces.</p>
            <p>Cut the drumstick away from the thigh, and chop both of those parts into 1-inch pieces as well.</p>
            <p>Also, separate the wing tip from the chicken wing.</p>
            <p>Repeat this process with the other half of the chicken.</p>

            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Create sauce & ladle onto chicken</strong></li>
            <p>Add 3 ladlefuls of the soy sauce from earlier into the wok. Turn the heat on high and let it come to a boil.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, prepare a slurry with cornstarch (2 tbsp) and water (4 tbsp).</p>
            <p>Turn the heat down to low and slowly pour in the slurry, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.</p>
            <p>Add sesame oil (1 dash) to taste, and adjust the flavor of the sauce as necessary. Ladle the sauce over the chicken, making sure every piece gets some sauce.</p>
