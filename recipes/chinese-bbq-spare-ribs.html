            <li>2 tbsp maltose/honey (If you don't have maltose/honey, you can make a glaze of 2 tbsp of white granulated sugar and 2 tbsp of water.)</li>

        <h3 class="info-title">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Prepare the spare ribs</strong></li>
            <p>Create cuts between the bones and along the thick side of the ribs (3 lb) so that the meat takes on the flavors better and that it cooks faster.</p>
            <p>Remove moisture from the ribs by dabbing both sides with kitchen paper - this allows the ribs to take on the flavors better too.</p>

            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Rub seasoning</strong></li>
            <p>Rub garlic salt (1 tbsp) onto the ribs. Make sure to cover all surfaces on both sides. Pay special attention to the slits that you made earlier.</p>

            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Create marinade</strong></li>
            <p>In a medium bowl, mix sugar (1 tbsp), salt (2 tsp), white pepper (1 tsp), ketchup (2 tbsp), cooking wine (2 tbsp), five-spice powder (0.50 tsp), and red food coloring (0.25 tsp) (which is optional). Set aside for the next step.</p>

            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Marinate and refrigerate ribs</strong></li>
            <p>Place ribs in a tray lined with a plastic sheet and spread the marinade thinly onto both sides of the ribs. Wrap ribs with the plastic sheet when finished.</p>
            <p>Refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours and a maximum of 8 hours. Daddy Lau recommends marinating in the morning and cooking it at night after you're finished with work.</p>
            <p>Note that the meat will get tough if you let it marinate for too long.</p>

            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Prepare glaze</strong></li>
            <p>For the glaze, you can use maltose or honey (2 tbsp). Brush it over the spare ribs and they'll glisten and taste great.</p>
            <p>If you don't have either of those, you can combine 2 tbsp sugar and 2 tbsp water in a small bowl. Microwave for one minute, stir the mixture, and microwave for another one minute. Make sure to mix the syrup in between otherwise the sugar may burn.</p>
            <p>You'll know when it's done when the syrup sticks to the spoon. When it cools down, it'll thicken up more. BE CAREFUL AS THE SYRUP IS VERY HOT AT FIRST!</p>
        
            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Rest and bake ribs</strong></li>
            <p>Remove ribs from the refrigerator and allow them to rest for about an hour. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
            <p>Line the baking pan with foil, put a baking tray above the foil, and bake the ribs for 30-35 minutes.</p>
            <p>Do not cover the meat as it will take longer to cook and you won't get any charring on the surface.</p>


            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Glaze ribs</strong></li>
            <p>After 30-35 minutes of baking, remove the ribs and brush the glaze of choice onto them.</p>
            <p>Put the ribs back into the oven for 10 more minutes.</p>

            <li class="sub-info-title"><strong>Rest ribs, cut, taste test & plate</strong></li>
            <p>Once the ribs have been baking for about 45 minutes in total, take it out and let it rest for 10 minutes.</p>
            <p>If you cut into it while it's still hot, the juice will all come out.</p>
            <p>Taste to adjust the flavors and plate once it's to your taste! This is usually served on a large serving plate and everyone can take the amount they want.</p>
