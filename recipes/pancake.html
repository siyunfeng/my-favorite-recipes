        <h3 class="info-title">Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Serves: </strong>2  |  <strong>Prep Time: </strong>10 mins  |  <strong>Cook Time </strong>15 mins  |  <strong>Yield: </strong>6-8 medium (3-inch) pancakes</p>
        <p><strong>Note: </strong>We made our own blueberry compote to go on top; simply combine 1 cup blueberries, 2 tbsp sugar, and 1 tsp lemon juice in a small pot over medium-low heat and simmer for 5-6 minutes, stirring continuously, until a thick mixture has formed. If you’d like the berries to remain intact, stir gently; if you want a thicker jam-like consistency, mash them as you stir.</p>

        <h3 class="info-title">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 heaping tsp baking powder (about 1⅓ tsp)</li>
            <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
            <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>   
            <li>¼ cup (4 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted, plus 2 tsp unmelted for the griddle</li>    
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ cup blueberries or sliced bananas and 1/3 cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>2 tbsp confectioners’ sugar or cinnamon sugar for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="box-recipe">
        <h3 class="info-title">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure and sift all the dry ingredients into a large (preferably stainless-steel) mixing bowl: flour, baking powder, sugar, salt.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, whisk together the yolks, milk, melted butter, and vanilla until combined. Whisk the wet mixture into the dry mixture. The result should be slightly lumpy, yet combined to form a batter.</li>
            <li>Whip the egg whites in a medium mixing bowl until they reach medium peaks (soft in the middle). You can either whip them by hand with a whisk, or put them in the bowl of an electric mixer to whip. Be careful not to over-whip the egg whites.</li>
            <li>Gently mix half of the whipped whites into the batter with a large rubber spatula. Then gently fold the remaining half into the batter. Keep in mind this batter should be slightly lumpy and have large parts of egg whites not fully incorporated; it should look like whitecaps in the ocean with foam on top. (If you plan to take a break at this point before cooking, the batter will last a few hours in the fridge without deflating too much.)</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle—either an electric griddle, a stovetop griddle, or a big flat pan—to 350 to 375°F. Grease the hot griddle with the remaining butter. Drop a cup (approximately 4 tbsp) of pancake batter on the griddle and cook to set. Add 1 tbsp blueberries or sliced bananas and 1 tsp walnuts before turning the pancakes. (Note: Always add the fruit to the pancakes once they’re on the griddle, never prior in the pancake mix.) When you see bubbles start to form on top, lift the pancake halfway up to see if it’s golden brown and crispy on the edges. If ready, flip the pancake.</li>
            <li>When the pancake is golden brown on both sides, remove with a spatula. Repeat with the remaining batter and filling, cooking several pancakes at a time. Garnish with confectioners’ sugar for the blueberry pancakes, cinnamon sugar for the banana-walnut. Serve warm with maple butter.</li>
        </ol>
